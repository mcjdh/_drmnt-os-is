## Quick Start

### Running the Main Gate
```bash
cd dreamnet
python main_gate.py
```

### Basic Usage Flow
1. **Start the system** - Launch main_gate.py
2. **Select an option** - Choose from numbered menu options
3. **Generate dreams** - Use option 1 or 2 for single generation
4. **Explore features** - Try batch processing, theme exploration, or configuration management
5. **Exit gracefully** - Use option 0 or Ctrl+C to exit

### Menu Options Explained

| Option | Feature | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Single Dream (Original) | Generate one dream using the original engine |
| 2 | Single Dream (V2) | Generate one dream using the V2 engine |
| 3 | Basic Batch | Simple batch processing with basic options |
| 4 | Optimized Batch | Advanced batch processing with performance monitoring |
| 5 | Brain Manager | Create, edit, delete, and manage brain configurations |
| 6 | Theme Explorer | Browse and explore available themes |
| 7 | Session Stats | View current session statistics and performance |
| 8 | System Config | Manage cache, dependencies, and system settings |
| 9 | Help | Display comprehensive help and documentation |
| 0 | Exit | Graceful shutdown with session summary |

## Configuration Management

### Creating New Brain Configurations
1. Select option 5 (Brain Configuration Manager)
2. Choose option 1 (Create new brain configuration)
3. Enter a name and dream parameters
4. Configuration is automatically saved as `brain_{name}.json`

### Managing Existing Configurations
- **Edit**: Modify intent and style of existing configurations
- **Activate**: Set a configuration as the active `brain.json`
- **Delete**: Remove configurations with confirmation prompts

## Batch Processing

### Basic Batch Generation
- Process multiple configurations sequentially
- Single engine selection
- Simple progress reporting

### Optimized Batch Generation
- Advanced performance monitoring
- Multi-engine support (process with both engines)
- Custom batch sizes
- Detailed success/failure reporting
- Cache performance metrics

## Performance Features

### Caching System
- **Configuration Caching**: Automatically cache frequently accessed configurations
- **Memory + File Caching**: Dual-layer caching for optimal performance
- **Cache Statistics**: Monitor hit rates and performance improvements
- **Cache Management**: Clear, rebuild, or inspect cache status

### Optimization Settings
- **Batch Size Control**: Adjust processing batch sizes (1-20)
- **Timeout Configuration**: Customize timeouts for different operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of operation success rates

## Error Handling & Safety

### Soft Lock Prevention
- All menus have clear exit options
- Ctrl+C support throughout the system
- Input validation with timeout protection
- Graceful error recovery

### File Safety
- Automatic backup of `brain.json` during batch processing
- Prevention of same-file copy operations
- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Safe configuration switching

### System Recovery
- Session data clearing capabilities
- Cache invalidation and rebuilding
- Dependency checking and verification
- Comprehensive error reporting

## System Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Existing DreamNet installation (`dream.py`, `dream_v2.py`, `config.json`)
- Optional: Ollama (system falls back to enhanced mode if unavailable)

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Menu not responding**: Use Ctrl+C to exit and restart
- **Cache issues**: Use System Configuration > Cache Management to clear/rebuild
- **Configuration errors**: Check System Configuration > Dependencies
- **Performance issues**: Adjust optimization settings in System Configuration

### Recovery Options
- Clear session data to reset state
- Rebuild cache to fix caching issues
- Check dependencies to verify system requirements
- Reset optimization settings to defaults

## Performance Tips

1. **Use caching**: Let the system cache configurations for better performance
2. **Optimize batch sizes**: Adjust batch sizes based on your system capabilities
3. **Monitor statistics**: Check session statistics to track performance
4. **Clear cache periodically**: Rebuild cache if experiencing performance issues

## Integration

The Main Gate system is designed to work seamlessly with existing DreamNet components:
- Preserves all original functionality of `dream.py` and `dream_v2.py`
- Uses existing configuration files (`config.json`, `brain.json`)
- Maintains compatibility with existing echo and log systems
- Extends functionality without modifying core engines

This system transforms the DreamNet prototype from a basic command-line tool into a robust, interactive platform suitable for production use while maintaining the mystical essence of the original vision.
